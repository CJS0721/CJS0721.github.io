  Welcome to Coco-pomelo'blog ! "Coco" means coconut, "Coco-pomelo" means coconut and pomelo,which are my own and my girlfriend's nicknames respectively.
This site serves as an example for the Bay Jekyll theme. Bay is a very simple and minimal theme, directly inspired by Dan Grover's <a href="http://dangrover.com">website</a>.
</p>

  You can find the source code and the instructions on <a href="https://github.com/eliottvincent/bay">GitHub</a>.

 Here, I will share my life, including but not limited to my research, my love, and my thoughts~

The picture on the right was created by Pomelo in 2021, I like it so much that I use it as my Wechat's profile picture. But some days ago(maybe 2023.8), 
she told me she wanted to change a new one ,including me. Aaaaaa, Emmmm, I used some tricks, so I saved my favorite  profile picture finally! 
At least for now :)
